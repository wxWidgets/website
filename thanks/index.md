### Software and Financial Donations

[VMware, Inc.][VMware] has supplied free VMware licences to members of the wxWidgets
development team. VMware is a superb solution for people who need to access
more than one operating system simultaneously. A big thank you to VMware for
supporting the project.

[VMware]: https://www.vmware.com/

Thank you to [Microsoft][] for donating a copy of Visual C++ 6.0 to help
wxWidgets compile on this version of the compiler (for a Virginia Tech course).

[Microsoft]: https://www.microsoft.com/

Michael Bedward has made a donation to support the wxWidgets 2 for Motif port.

Shiv Shankar Ramakrishnan, a Microsoft employee with wxWidgets development
experience, has very generously donated a massive amount of Microsoft software
to core wxWidgets developers, which has allowed us to test wxWidgets against
VC++ 7 and generally get us up-to-date with operating systems and other
packages in 2003. Many many thanks to Shiv! Some of us would still be in the
dark ages without this donation.

Rob Chandler has donated a license for [H2Reg][], a program for integrating MS
HTML Help into the Visual Studio .NET help system for our use in 2003.

### Hosting

The stipends from our participation in [Google Summer of Code][GSoC] allow Bryan Petty to finance the hosting for this website, the online user manuals, wxTrac, the read-only SVN and the wxWiki.

## Credits

There are hundreds of people who have made wxWidgets possible through donated
hardware, services, development, documentation, translations, and support. We
couldn't possibly list them all here over the last twenty years, however, we
would like to highlight just a few of those rockstars.

### Developers

We would particularly like to thank the following for their [contributions to
wxWidgets][github contributors], and the many others who have been involved in the project over the
years. Apologies for any unintentional omissions from this list.

  oh well

* wxWidgets 1 for Xt: Markus Holzem - keeping his sanity now he's away
* wxString, wxConfig, Windows drag and drop, and loads of other great stuff
