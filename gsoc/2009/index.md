title: GSoC 2009

We had three projects as part of Google Summer of Code 2009:

----

### Ribbon bar component
Student: Peter Cawley
Mentor: Julian Smart

Original proposal:

> The wxWidgets library is currently lacking a ribbon bar component. The ribbon
> bar has been popularised by programs like Microsoft Office 2007, and there
> are recurring requests for a wxWidgets implementation. I propose to implement
> a collection of classes which make it easier for application programmers to
> implement a ribbon bar in their programs.

The project was a great success and
[wxRibbonBar](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_ribbon_bar.html) has been
part of wxWidgets since 2010.

### File System Watcher
Student: Bartosz Bekier
Mentor: Vadim Zeitlin

Original proposal:

> wxWidgets aims to provide developers with a good solution to build
> cross-platform applications. This includes GUI libraries and a set of
> companion wrapper libraries for networking, multi threading and more. File
> system notification support I intend to implement will enable new exciting
> opportunities for developers using wxWidgets: creating cross-platform
> indexing solutions, interactive file managers, reloading configuration files
> in apps, advanced backup and synchronizing software and lots more.

The project was a qualified success as the class functionality was mostly
implemented even if several bugs remained.

### AUI enhancements
Student: Malcolm MacLeod
Mentor: Bryan Petty

Original proposal:

> With this project I will fully integrate tabs into the wxAUI interface, both
> for drag and drop creation of tabs by users as well as for loading and saving
> of perspectives. Additionally provided enough time is left over after the
> primary goal I will integrate proper tested fixes for various other
> outstanding problems and minor feature enhancements in AUI.
