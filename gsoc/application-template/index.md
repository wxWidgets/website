### Programming Experience

As described in the [making patches](../making-patches/) page, we require the
applicants to submit at least one simple patch to wxWidgets to show your
ability to work with its source code, so please provide links to the patch,
or patches, you have submitted.

Please also briefly describe your experience in the following areas:

* Experience with C++ in general.
* Prior experience with wxWidgets.
* Experience with programming on each of the target platforms (depending on
  the project it could be only one platform, such as Windows, or several, such
  as all of Windows, Unix and Mac OS X).
* Experience with tools used in wxWidgets development such as git, Bakefile,
  platform-specific compilers/debuggers, etc.

The answer for each question could be as brief as just one of "none", "a
little", "a fair amount", "a lot", "expert" or more detailed if you have more
to say about it.

### Other Experience

Please describe details of your academic, industry, and/or open source
development experience, and other details as you see fit. An explanation of
your development methodology is a good idea as well.

## About Your Proposal

### Project Goals

Describe the goals of the project and its benefits. Please be concrete and
identify each of the targets precisely. A link to any discussion of your
project on the mailing list would also be beneficial.

Please also describe why do you want to work on this project and don't
hesitate to explain your advantages compared to other applicants.

### Schedule

Outline your proposed schedule for deliverables. We'd like steps on the route
