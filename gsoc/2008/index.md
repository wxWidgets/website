The following two projects were undertaken as part of GSoC 2008:

### Wall control
Student: Mokhtar M. Khorshid
Mentor: Julian Smart

The project unfortunately didn't achieve its goals and wxWallCtrl is still
not available for the general use.

[git branch](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/tree/SOC2008_WXWALLCTRL)

### Fixing bugs in wxGTK and wxMSW
Student: Marcin Wojdyr
Mentor: Vadim Zeitlin

This project was very successful, a huge number of bugs, including a lot of
inconsistencies between the platforms, was fixed and a lot of unit tests added.
