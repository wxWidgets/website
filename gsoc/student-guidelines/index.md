Here are some tips about how to make a better proposal for a Google Summer of
Code project.

* **Communicate** - Please post to the wx-dev mailing list and discuss your
  proposal before submitting it, this will certainly help you to make a better
  one. Also, communicating with the other developers is a prerequisite for
  working on any open source project so it is important to show that you don't
  shy away from it. Don't be bothered if English isn't your
  native language, it is the case for most of people on wx-dev (including the
  writer of this page) as well!

* **Manage your time** - Please try to not underestimate the scope of a
  project, but also not to overestimate it. Defining clear milestones helps a
  lot here. Remember that you must make working on your wxWidgets project your
  main activity for the entire summer, don't count on doing other work in
  parallel with it.

* **Sell your idea** - Describe your idea in detail. What is the ultimate
  goal? What components will it have? What are the benefits for the user
  (usually a wxWidgets-based application developers)? How do you plan to ensure
  that the project gets completed on time? If a more detailed explanation of
  the idea already exists, what will you do that will go above and beyond all
  expectations?

* **Sell yourself** - Make sure you get across how enthusiastic you are about
  the project. The more enthusiastic you are, the more assured we will be that
  you will finish your project. It also indicates that there is a good chance
  you will stick around even after the Summer of Code has finished. Why are you
  interested in Open Source and wxWidgets in particular? What interests do you
  have, and how do these relate to the project for which you are applying?

* **Prove yourself** - As a particularly important part of the above, show us
  that you're capable of participating in wxWidgets development. Students who
  had already participated in wxWidgets development start with an advantage but
  even if you hadn't yet, the following should provide an easy start:
  1. clone the latest master at <https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets>;
  2. build the library (build files are under `build/` subfolder and `readme`-s under `docs/` ;
  3. build and run samples, located under `samples/` (i.e. `widgets/`, `minimal/`, others more appropriate for the targeted project etc.);
  4. you should try working on one of the [simple bugs](http://trac.wxwidgets.org/query?status=accepted&status=confirmed&status=infoneeded&status=infoneeded_new&status=new&status=reopened&keywords=~simple) and [make a patch](../making-patches). This will count a _lot_ for your application.

* **Be enthusiastic** - Summer of Code is a very exciting opportunity, and
  wxWidgets is a very exciting project, with a long and proven history, to work
  on. We aren't just looking for someone who wants a summer job to pass their
  time and earn some money. We want people who have a passion towards open
  source and are likely to become constant contributors to wxWidgets and open
  source also once the summer has passed. The goal of the whole initiative is
  to have students find their way to open source together with mentoring and a
  good motivation.

* **Don't be afraid** - Do you have a brilliant idea not covered on the project
  ideas page? Excellent! We'd love to hear it.

Please use the [application template](../application-template/) for your
application and don't miss the deadline!
