title: GSoC 2011
---

We had four projects during Google Summer of Code 2011:

----

### wxWidgets port for GTK+3
Student: John Chain
Mentor: Paul Cornett

Original proposal:

> The release of GTK+3 in March and GNOME 3 in April is a big event in the
> open-source desktop community this year. Adopting GTK+3 as soon as possible
> is strategically important to the entire wxWidgets project. This GSoC 2011
> project is to port wxGTK from GTK+2 to GTK+3.

The project was a qualified success and experimental support for GTK+ 3 was
included in the next wxWidgets release.

### wxWidgets port for iOS
Student: Linas Valiukas
Mentor: Stefan Csomor

Original proposal:

> The wxiOS project is an effort to create a wxWidgets based C++ wrapper over
> Cocoa Touch that would implement the proposed wxMobile API. The
> implementation would allow creating mobile UIs in a more generic,
> platform-independent way. If, for example, an analogue gets implemented
> for Android OS, one could expect to run the same end-user mobile
> application code on both mobile platforms without too much hassle.

This project was successful in its scope, but wxiOS still remains in highly
experimental state.

### Cross-platform animation support
Student: Bogdan Gabriel Chiciu
Mentor: Vadim Zeitlin

Original proposal:

> This a project proposal for improving the wxWidgets toolkit by providing a
> common framework for animating user controls. The proposed framework
> consists of two parts: a basic property based animation framework and
> bitmap manipulation based animation framework. The full details of the
> implementation will be discussed via the wxWidgets mailing list.

The project started rather well but unfortunately the student has disappeared
immediately after the mid-term and it was never finished.

### wxWebView Integration
Student: Steven Lamerton
Mentor: Julian Smart

Original proposal:

> wxWidgets currently lacks any classes for modern web viewing. The built in
> wxHTML classes are only suitable for viewing simple HTML files with basic CSS
> support. This proposal aims to integrate the wxWebView patch by Marianne
> Gagnon into wxWidgets by adding build support, creating documentation and
> unit tests and finishing functionality. If time allows it also aims to add
> extra back-ends and improve the current HTML help system using the new class.

This project was spectacularly successful and
[wxWebView](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_web_view.html) was one of
the most important and highly anticipated additions in the next wxWidgets
release.
