title: GSoC 2006
---

wxWidgets applied for the first time to Google Summer of Code in 2006 and
participated with two projects:

### Sockets
Student: Angel Vidal Veiga
Mentor: Kevin Nathan Hock

The goal of this project was to improve wxSocket class and the network-related
classes built on top of it. It wasn't fully successful but the rest of the work
was done, with Angel's help, several years later.

### RTL
Student: Diaa Sami
Mentor: Vadim Zeitlin

The basics of support for right-to-left languages were added to wxMSW and wxGTK
during this project.
