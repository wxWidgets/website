title: Project Rating Descriptions
---

All of our GSoC project suggestions have both a difficulty and importance
rating, set by the wxWidgets core developers to help you choose a project.

### Difficulty

Difficulty is roughly estimated on a 1 to 10 scale. When looking at projects
you should keep your own level of experience in mind, this can make a big
difference to the difficulty. You should also try and pick a project which
is neither too easy nor too hard. You need to be able to complete the project
over the summer, but also have enough work to do.

### Importance

Importance is our estimation of the project importance for the wxWidgets
community and it is also rated on a 1 to 10 scale. Projects of higher
importance will have a bigger impact on wxWidgets and you are likely to get
more feedback and suggestions from the community whilst working on them.
