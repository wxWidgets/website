### Changes since 3.2.7

The focus of this release, coming soon after the previous one, is to fix
several problems found in 3.2.7:

- Fix crash in `wxPropertyGrid` with wxGTK3 after recent change ([#25286]).
- Fix padding of `wxMenu` in high DPI under Windows 11 ([#25117]).
- Fix key codes in `WXK_NUMPADx` events in wxGTK ([#25263]).
- Fix ABI breakage for versioned symbols in 3.2.7 ([#25327]).
- Fix third party libraries build with Xcode 16.3.
- Fix using OpenGL and WebView when using CMake install ([#25266]).

But it still contains a couple of enhancements, including:

- Add `wxVector(std::initializer_list<U> list)` constructor ([#25290]).
- Add mouse scrolling support to generic `wxSpinCtrl` ([#24935]).
- Add `@USER@` macro to HTML and RichText printers ([#25318]).

Other changes include:

- Call `OnExceptionInMainLoop()` in wxGTK if idle event handler throws ([#25312]).
- Compute `wxStaticText` best size ourselves if GTK does it wrongly ([#24781]).
- Fix page count display in `wxHtmlPrintout` when there is only one page ([#25320]).
- Miscellaneous CMake build improvements ([#25324]).
- Fix new warnings with gcc 15 ([#25338]).
- Update Brazilian Portuguese translations.

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x releases, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.
