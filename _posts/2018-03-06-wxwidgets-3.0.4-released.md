wxWidgets 3.0.4, the latest release in the stable 3.0 series, is now
[available][1]. Upgrading to it is strongly recommended for all users of the
previous 3.0.x release as it brings a lot of bug fixes and support for newer
compilers (MinGW 4.9, 5 and 7), SDKs (macOS 10.10 and later) and libraries
(GStreamer 1.0) but remains 100% compatible with 3.0.0, both at the API and
the ABI level, and so upgrading to it doesn't require absolutely any changes
to the existing applications.

The [announcement post][2] contains the fuller list of the most important
changes in this release and they are described in even more details in the
[change log][3].

As usual, in addition to the sources, you can also download binaries for the
selected Windows compilers (any version of Microsoft Visual C++ from 2008 to
2017, [MinGW-TDM][4] 4.9.2 or 5.1.0, or [MinGW][6] 7.2.0). And you can read the documentation for
this release [online][5].

Thanks to everybody who contributed, by reporting bugs and submitting patches,
to this wxWidgets release. We hope you will find it even better than the
previous one and will enjoy using it!
