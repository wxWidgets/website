### Changes since 3.2.2

This release contains many important bug fixes, including for some
regressions in the previous 3.2.x releases, as well as build system
improvements and a few optimizations.

Without listing all of them, areas with the most improvements were:

- Internationalization support: fix setting Chinese and some other
  locales in wxOSX and setting Ukrainian locale in wxMSW and fix loading
  wxWidgets translations with `wxTranslations::AddStdCatalog()`.

- Wayland support in wxGTK and, in particular, OpenGL support under
  Wayland: fix hiding `wxGLCanvas` and avoid catastrophically slowing
  down the entire program when it is hidden; fix crash when using IME;
  fixes to popup windows, menus and `wxPreferencesEditor` behaviour.

- Validators and input: don't allow pasting characters forbidden by
  `wxTextValidator`; do allow entering temporary invalid value when using
  numeric validators. Also fix entering dates in `wxGenericDatePicker` in
  `"nb_NO"` and other locales using months names in short date format.

- Key event generation: more fixes for non-US keyboard layout in wxGTK
  and also generate events for Command+Alt+Letter combination in wxOSX.

All in all, this release includes more than 200 fixes from almost 50
contributors, please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x releases, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.
