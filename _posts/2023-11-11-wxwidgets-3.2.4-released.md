Yet another release in the stable 3.2 series is now [available on GitHub][1].
You will find there archives with the library sources and
documentation as well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as
[Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/),
[MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/) and
[TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/). You can also read the
[updated documentation][2] for this version and, in particular, if you're
new to wxWidgets, you may find the [installation guide][3] a good starting
point.

### Changes since 3.2.3

This release comes very soon after 3.2.3 because some of the changes
in the last release resulted in regressions fixed by this release.
Notably, 3.2.4 fixes a critical bug which made applications using wxGTK
but not initializing the GUI to crash (see issue [#23981]).

Other bug fixes include:

- Fix regression in `wxTranslations::AddCatalog()` return value ([#24019]).
- Fix possible crash and too high CPU use when using EGL ([#24018]).
- Fix losing clipboard contents when clearing a different selection ([#23988]).
- Fix possible crash when dragging pages in `wxAuiNotebook` ([#24027]).
- Fix refreshing multiple selection items in generic `wxListCtrl`.
- Fix showing windows for background apps under macOS Sonoma ([#23893]).

The only new addition in this release is the possibility to create objects
of wx legacy "dynamic arrays" class from `std::initializer_list<>` ([#23966]).

Please see the full [change log] for more details.

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x releases, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.
