*   [H-ITT][32] releases Mac OS X and Linux versions of their software.

    H-ITT's software is now cross platform thanks to open source wxWidgets C++
    framework.

    Hyper-Interactive Teaching Technology (H-ITT), a leader in hand-held remote
    technology for the classroom, today announced the release of a Mac OS X and
    Linux version of their Analyzer Software.

    H-ITT's Analyzer, used for grading student responses and communicating with
    students via e-mail now runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows operating
    systems. This release is yet another one of H-ITT's major advances in
    audience response technology. With this release H-ITT becomes the first
    vendor to release software for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
    All three of these operating systems are in use in the higher education
    environment. This allows H-ITT's clients to work with the operating system
    of their choice.

    H-ITT accomplished this feat by utilizing the popular open-source wxWidgets
    C++ framework. This framework allows H-ITT's software development team to
    target multiple platforms from one code base. In addition, utilizing
    wxWidgets allows the applications to have the native look-and-feel of their
    respective operating systems.

    "We started using wxWidgets 4 years ago knowing that if we ever need to do
    a Mac or Linux version we could. The port went very smoothly. In fact, I
    wouldn't even call it porting because almost no changes were made to the
    source code. We can now target all three platforms with ease and we like
    the native look and feel each application has on its operating system,"
    says Larry, head of H-ITT's application development team.

    H-ITT users can now collect data in class from the students on Windows
    machine utilizing the Acquisition software and grade and analyze it on the
    operating system of their choice. This is due in part to the cross platform
    XML file format. H-ITT plans to release a Mac OS X and Linux version of the
    Acquisition program in time for the start of the spring 2005 semester.

*   The web site has been reworked, with a simplified toolbar and stronger
    colours. A search facility is now in place thanks to Google, and the screen
    shots section is prettier and more extensive.
*   A wxWidgets user has pointed out a very interesting article:
    [Case Study: Clusters and Image Processing][69] at LinuxPlanet. This
    describes the port to Linux of a *very* large application, and they chose
    wxWidgets for their GUI. "ImageLinks now uses the Open Source version of
    wxWidgets for all its current GUI development. Doing this ensures that
    everything interfaces cleanly and also makes it easier in the long run to
    add other GUIs along the way because ImageLinks has access to all the
    source code."

*   Good progress is being made on the wxWidgets for X11 port, which uses the
    wxUniversal widgets and requires only the X11 libraries. wxWidgets/X11 will
    be usable in embedded applications, along with Tiny-X or Nano-X
    (MicroWindows).

#### January 14th, 2002

*   There's a CodingStyle interview with several of the wxWidgets developers on
    Steve Frampton's site.

#### January 4th, 2002

*   wxWidgets 2.2.9 is the latest stable release. Various fixes, as summarised
    in changes.txt.

#### December 17th, 2001

*   A big thank-you to VMware for supplying VMware 3.0 licences to wxWidgets
    developers.

#### December 11th, 2001

*   wxWidgets 2.3.2 is the second major release of the development tree. The
    biggest change in the development version is that the Mac version is now
    90% ready for production use and supports MacOS 8.6 or higher as well as
    MacOS X or higher.

    Additionally, a new port has been created - called wxUniversal - which
    draws all widgets itself instead of using the various native GUIs. This is
    aimed at embedded devices or special controls on the existing platforms.

    The OS/2 port is also improving step by step, although it is not yet ready
    for general use. Its basics might be used in connection with the
    wxUniversal code in the near future.

    Last but not least, the two main platforms, Windows and GTK+, as well as
    the generic code, have seen hundreds of improvements and additions.

#### July 2nd, 2001

*   See the wxUniversal page for news of the generic widget project, as well as
    the wxMGL and wxMicroWindows ports that will use it.

#### June 22nd, 2001

*   wxWidgets 2.3.1 is the first complete development snapshot for a long time.
    We have waited until as many bugs as possible were fixed and some stability
    (for a development branch!) was achieved, so that people who really need
    the new features can start using it. Compared with the 2.2.x releases,
    there are various new classes including wxFileName, wxToggleButton,
    wxDbGrid, wxContextHelp, wxHelpProvider, wxSplashScreen. There are also
    improvements to many other classes, plus peripheral class libraries such as
    wxCanvas, wxPlot and wxRC (the new XML-based wxWidgets resource system).
    For other changes, please see the change log.

#### May 22nd, 2001

*   wxWidgets 2.2.7 has further fixes since 2.2.6. You may also like to check
    out the development snapshots in the same section. The main download site
    is now SourceForge.

#### March 12th, 2001

*   wxWidgets 2.2.6 is the latest stable distribution with a small number of
    fixes since 2.2.5.
*   The comp.soft-sys.wxwindows usenet group has now been created!

#### January 31st, 2001

*   wxWidgets 2.2.5 includes more fixes.

#### August 21st, 2000

*   wxWidgets 2.2.1 is the latest official stable release. The most bug-free,
    easiest-to-install release yet...

#### July 28th, 2000

*   Vaclav Slavik has recently written an article about wxWidgets for a Czech ezine.
*   Dr Dobbs Journal also carries a piece on wxWidgets.
*   There is a lot of traffic on the wxStudio mailing list, and Gerd Mueller
    has offered to make the WipeOut IDE open source and merge it with wxStudio.
    There is a new [wxStudio][71] page on SourceForge.

[71]: http://wxstudio.sourceforge.net/

#### July 9th, 2000

*   wxWidgets 2.2.0 is the result of many fixes and enhancements to 2.1, and is
    an official stable release.

#### June 4th, 2000

*   wxWidgets 2.1.16 contains fixes for wxGTK, wxMSW and wxMotif. It is hoped
    that this is the last release before the stable 2.2 version.

#### May 1st, 2000

*   [Sams Teach Yourself C++ for Linux in 21 Days][sams] has a chapter on GUI
    programming with several pages devoted to wxWidgets. This chapter was
    written by Jonathan Parry-McCulloch. The accompanying CD-ROM contains a
    wxWidgets distribution.

[sams]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672318954/ref=rm_item

#### March 28th, 2000

*   wxWidgets 2.1.15 contains a few fixes for wxGTK and wxMSW. wxMSW and
    wxMotif users who already have 2.1.14 do not need to rush to download this
    version! The fixes in the patch file (see main download page) contain the
    major differences between 2.1.14 and 2.1.15.

#### March 21st, 2000

*   wxWidgets 2.1.14 is now available for Windows, Motif and GTK. Again, great
    strides have been made since the previous official version (2.1.11), and
    2.2 will be the next official stable version. Many things have been fixed
    and added.
*   Robin Dunn is contributing a wxStyledTextCtrl, a wrapper around the
    [Scintilla][72] styled text edit control. It can be used to provide syntax
    highlighting for various languages, and other applications. A snapshot of
    this work in progress, stc.zip, is provided on the ftp site alongside the
    latest wxWidgets release.
*   Guilhem Lavaux has reworked his MMedia sound and video class library and
    started its documentation; it too is available alongside the latest release
    as mmedia.zip.

[72]: http://www.scintilla.org/

#### January 14th, 2000

*   Mumit Khan of Mingw32 fame has been testing wxWidgets against Mingw32, to
    eliminate some bugs in both products and get wxWidgets compilation as a DLL
    working for Mingw32.
*   Vadim has added his wxDateTime and wxCalendarCtrl classes and samples to
    the CVS archive.
*   TIFF support has been added, and wxImage speeded up.
*   Guillermo Rodriguez Garcia has added a new Game of Life demo.
*   The DDE sample now works in socket mode, at last.
*   Vadim has got clipboard copy and paste working for metafiles, by adding an
    enhanced metafile class.
*   The wxWidgets web site is now hosted on SourceGear's server, with a bug
    tracker and other facilities to follow shortly.

#### November 9th, 1999

wxWidgets 2.1.11 is now available for Windows, Motif and GTK. The final 2.2
public release will have further bug fixes, but 2.1.11 is pretty stable - a big
improvement on 2.0.1 and better than previous snapshots. Here are a few of the
features that make it well worth the upgrade:

*   Numerous bug fixes and consistency improvements.
*   Further samples.
*   Factoring out of some code into base classes, for easier maintenance.
*   Ability to compile library in console (non-GUI) mode.
*   Integration of wxHTML widget and help controller into wxWidgets. wxHTML
    allows HTML viewing and printing (wxGTK and wxMSW, partial support in
    wxMotif).
*   New classes wxChrono, wxDialUpManager, wxFontEnumerator, wxWizard,
    wxStaticLine, etc.
*   wxShowTip for showing 'startup tips' to the user.
*   wxSocket and wxThread classes rewritten.
*   New, consistent drag and drop API (not wxMotif).
*   Better-looking dialogs in wxGTK; native message box used in wxMotif.
*   wxSizers reimplemented and used to specify window layout for some generic
    dialogs.
*   New, more sophisticated wxGrid class (in beta). The old grid class can
    still be used.
*   Text alignment options in wxStaticText.
*   wxImage class extended to read PCX and GIF files.
*   Documentation improvements.
*   Revised configure system for wxGTK and wxMotif; tmake-based system for
    generating wxMSW makefiles.
*   Installer for Windows as alternative to zip archives.

#### August 6th, 1999

Today, a snapshot release of the MSW and the GTK ports has been made. The two
snapshots are synchronized and have been tested for several weeks and should
thus be considered to be quite stable. Among the many new features that have
appeared since version 2.0 was release are:

*   A great number of incompatiblities between the GTK and the MSW port have
    been removed. This holds escecially true for the way, time and order,
    controls send notifications to the user program.
*   Practically all widgets have been updated, removing bugs or adding missing
    features to specific ports (mostly the GTK port).
*   The GTK port now supports GTK version 1.2 as well as 1.0, giving access to
    the many new features, such as e.g. menu accelerators.
*   Many of the non-GUI classes have been reworked and new ones added, the
    stream classes having undergone a complete rewrite.
*   The addition of code to handle Unicode has begun and is in an advanced
    state.
*   The Python bindings (wxPython) have been largely improved and upadted to
    the newest API and features.

#### July 31st, 1999

We are glad to announce the start of the work on the new wxWidgets port -
wxBeOS which will implement wxWidgets 2 API for BeOS. Thanks to Be for donating
licenses to wxWidgets project to make it possible.

If you're interested in helping with this new port, please write to wxWidgets
developers mailing list!

#### May 27th, 1999

*   Beta 1 of wxWidgets 2 for Mac has been released, thanks to Stefan Csomor's
    amazing efforts.
*   Work continues on the development branch of wxWidgets 2 for MSW, GTK and
    Motif. Vadim has been reworking the MSW implementation to solve some
    internal design problems, as well as factoring out base classes to make
    development easier.
*   Work on consistent drag and drop support in GTK and MSW continues.

#### March 1st, 1999

wxWidgets 2 launch day!

*   wxWidgets 2 officially launched, after more than two years' development of
    the API and ports to Windows, GTK and Motif (Mac to follow).

#### November 26th 1998

*   wxWidgets 1.68E contains minor bug fixes and now compiles with MS VC++ 6.0,
    and (hopefully) BC++ 5.0, as well as Cygwin b20.
*   The latest wxWidgets 2.0 alpha shows good progress on the Motif port, with
    a tabbed MDI implementation, a nice wxToolBar class and most major classes
    working. wxWidgets 2.0 for Windows now works with VC++ 6.0, BC++ 5.0 and
    Cygwin b20. There's a problem linking with Mingw32, I don't know why this
    is, perhaps something to do with differences in the way pragmas are
    handled.
*   There is also good progress with Stefan Csomor's wxMac 2.0: watch this
    space.
*   Work is finally underway on a wxWidgets IDE!
*   Aleksandras Gluchovas is working on a docking window implementation and the
    results are pretty impressive so far. The source also includes work on
    persistent storage classes.

#### September 13th 1998

*   The main ftp site is now www.remstar.com/pub/wxwin, since the AIAI site is
    no longer available for uploads.

#### August 23rd 1998

*   wxGTK and wxMSW 2.0 progress continues apace. The API is being unified
    quite successfully, and most of the samples now compile under both ports.
*   We are looking for sponsorship of wxMotif 2.0.

#### April 28th 1998

*   wxWidgets 1.68C has been released. This mainly provides compatibility with
    Gnu-Win32 b19 and Mingw32.
*   wxWidgets 2.0 beta 9 has been released. Again, this provides Gnu-Win32
    b19/Mingw32 compatibility plus a few small bug fixes.

#### March 22nd 1998

*   The mailing list addresses have changed. You may need to re-subscribe if
    you subscribed since February 1998.

#### January 5th 1998

*   wxWidgets 1.68B is available.
*   wxWidgets 2.0 has another port in progress - wxGTK by Robert Roebling.
*   The Windows and Xt/Motif ports to 2.0 are progressing well. A large
    proportion of the documentation has been done. One of the main things to
    resolve is how transformations (such as scaling and translation) will be
    done in 2.0, but we're heading towards agreement.
*   There is a new wxWidgets Developers Site in preparation, for people
    developing ports of wxWidgets. There are newsgroups and a wxwin-developers
    mailing list.
*   40 wxWidgets CD-ROMs have been sold, mostly outside the U.K.
*   Antonia Charlotte Smart was born on November 1st 1997. Naturally, she's as
    cute as her parents.

#### August 13th 1997

*   Added Getting Started page for new users.
*   There's a good review of wxWidgets by Oliver Niedung and Stefan Gunther in
    *iX*, a German computer magazine.

#### July 24th 1997

*   wxWidgets 1.67 released.

#### July 22nd 1997

*   Check out Forty Thieves, a great card game by Chris Breeze of Hitachi
    Europe Limited.

#### July 16th 1997

*   Jobst Schmalenbach has set up Australian FTP and HTTP mirrors.
*   Arthur Tetzlaff-Deas is starting to look afresh at a port of wxWidgets 2.0
    to NeXTStep. This is more relevant now that the NeXT OS will be essential
    to the Apple Mac's future.
*   The next release of wxWidgets for Motif/XView/Windows should be within the
    next two weeks or so. I have abandoned documentation in wxHelp form in
    favour of the much better quality HTML format, which I will be including
    with the distribution from now on.

#### July 7th 1997

*   For news on wxWidgets 2.0 development, please see "What's coming next?",
    developments include DLL and experimental Netscape Plugin support. The
    estimate for a release date has been put back to October 1997 - to be out
    of the way before Smart Jr. arrives in November...
*   Negotiations with a U.S. company about development of wxWidgets into a
    commercial product fell through, since it was not possible to agree about
    the continuation of a version of wxWidgets that maintains the free,
    collaborative spirit that currently exists.

#### May 18th 1997

*   wxWidgets 2.0 development (mostly for the Windows platform) is on track
    thanks to funding for wxWin-related consultancy - thank you to those
    concerned! This work is still on the free version of 2.0, although an
    additional commercial version may be developed sometime in the future.
    Markus Holzem continues to generously donate his spare time for Motif/Xt
    developments, and Greg Whitehead is looking into the Mac version of 2.0.
*   Guilhem Lavaux has contributed a first version of wxSocket, a set of
    classes for network programming based on work by Andrew Davison. Currently
    this works on Motif/Xt and is coded but not yet tested for Windows. The
    wxIPC classes on the UNIX side have been rewritten to take advantage of the
    new classes. wxSocket is a great contribution that will be a part of
    wxWidgets 2.0. Meanwhile, do check it out and help Guilhem debug and
    develop it further.
*   Other noteworthy contributions in recent weeks include a patch for using
    bitmap masks on X for transparency effects - another Lavaux effort! - plus
    thread classes by Wolfram Gloger, updates to wxXt by Markus Holzem, a start
    at OLE control support by Norbert Grotz, an improved Winstall by Stefan
    Hammes, and wxPreferences by Bart Jourquin to simulate .ini files on UNIX.
*   Check out the [Contributions FTP archive][74] for more.

#### May 8th 1997

*   Hitachi Europe Limited have used wxWidgets both to implement and to
    illustrate their WebReuser tool.
*   Another interesting link in the Applications page is WipeOut, a C++
    integrated development environment for Linux.
*   Fixes to make wxWidgets 1.66F work with VC++ 5.0 are in the
    [ports/msvc50][75] directory.

[75]: ftp://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/pub/ports/msvc50

#### April 20th 1997

*   wxWidgets is listed in the Scientific Applications on Linux index.
*   The wxWidgets Web pages can be switched to non-frames mode, for those who
    find frames irritating (and who use browsers that don't implement Back
    properly :-)).
*   wxWidgets 2.0 progress is steady.
*   Greg Whitehead is taking a look at what's involved for a Mac port of 2.0,
    possibly using MetroWerks' PowerPlant classes to speed up development.

#### March 13th 1997

*   Check out C-LAB's Lean Integration Platform written in wxWidgets/wxLisp:
    it's a multi-platform workflow tool.
*   wxWin 2.0 progress: I've eliminated the need for the dreaded CTL3D library
    for Windows 95 applications. New MDI classes are working, plus wxStatusBar,
    wxScrolledWindow. Markus is starting work on the Motif port, with wxXt 2.0
    as a second priority.

#### February 25th 1997

*   Yura Bidus has successfully adapted wxWidgets 1.66B to compile as a DLL
    under Borland C++. He will be patching 1.66F and investigating using VC++
    for building the DLL.
*   Early experiments indicate that application files using wxWidgets 2.0 and
    GNU-WIN32 will be at least twice as fast to compile as 1.66, due to
    elimination of base classes and restructuring to avoid including windows.h.

#### January 29th 1997

*   wxWidgets 1.66F has been semi-released for people to test before the
    official release. It works with GNU-WIN32, and contains miscellaneous bug
    fixes.
*   ITA, Inc. have sent a debugged and enhanced Mac port (building on 1.61).
*   Markus Holzem and Julian Smart are designing wxWidgets 2.0, which should
    make wxWidgets into a force to be reckoned with against other free and
    commercial libraries.
*   The mailing lists are up and running again, with new subscription and
    discussion list addresses.
