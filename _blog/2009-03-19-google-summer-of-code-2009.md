Excellent news: wxWidgets has been accepted to participate in [Google Summer of
Code 2009] again! Congratulations to the other 149 [accepted organizations] but
I'm especially glad about this one :-) I admit that I was rather worried about
it as we already were lucky enough to be part of GSoC during the last 3 years
and it was mentioned that some previously selected organizations couldn't be
accepted this year to make place for new ones. But all is well that ends well.

Now we need to attract enough good students applications before the [April 3
deadline] to be able to choose the best ones of them. And while we also have a
[list of proposed projects] we also are always looking for more so please update
the Wiki page or post to our mailing lists if you think you have an interesting
idea.

So if you are a wxWidgets user or a user of any wxWidgets application please
tell any students around you about the possibility to work on wxWidgets during
this summer. And, of course, if you are a student yourself, consider [applying]!
