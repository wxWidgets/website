And no, I'm not going to speak about why postponing 2.9.5 release for so long
after its initially scheduled October 2012 release date is a good thing.
Instead, I'd like to explain how can the recently added [CallAfter()] function
make your life simpler.

`CallAfter()` is a method of `wxEvtHandler`, which means that it's available in
the code of any classes deriving from it, including `wxWindow` but also `wxApp`
and several others. And it basically allows to call another method of the class
in which it is used asynchronously later. Notice that no threads are involved,
the call to that other method still happens on the same main GUI thread but at a
slightly later time. To be precise, the control first must return to the event
loop and only then (i.e. "after") the specified method will be called.

Using it is quite simple: if you want to call some method `Foo()` taking 0, 1 or 2
arguments (this is the current maximum but it could be extended in the future if
really needed), you can just write:

```cpp
void SomeWindow::OnSomeEvent(wxEvent& event) {
    // If the method doesn't take any arguments:
    CallAfter(&SomeWindow::Foo);

    // If the method takes an argument:
    CallAfter(&SomeWindow::Foo, arg1);

    // Or if it takes two:
    CallAfter(&SomeWindow::Foo, arg1, arg2);
}
```

Notice that `Foo()` _must_ be a method of the same class. But other than that,
this is pretty straightforward.

The above explains how to use `CallAfter()` but doesn't answer the really
interesting question which is, of course, why would you ever want to do this
instead of just calling `Foo()` directly? The answer is that some things often
just can't be done immediately in a GUI program, either because doing them would
interfere with its normal flow of control and generate extra events, potentially
resulting in unexpectedly re-entering the same event handler and infinite
recursion. Or because the current state of the program simply doesn't allow
them. An example of the first case is showing a message box from a window
activation event handler: doing this would immediately deactivate the window
back again which is probably unexpected. An example of the second case is
showing a message box from event handlers for all events generated by mouse
click, e.g. button press event: as the mouse is captured by the button when the
click happens, its mouse grab is released unexpectedly and the standard control
itself can get confused by it, e.g. the button could appear to be stuck in
pressed state.

The message box example is actually a poor one because wxWidgets already
provides an easy way to prevent such problems from happening by using
[wxLogMessage()] function which already postpones showing the message box until
the next event loop iteration. What `CallAfter()` does is to provide you with a
generic way to do the same thing very simply.

As a more realistic example, let's consider a common GUI layout with a [tree
control] on the left and some window displaying the items in the tree on the
right. Suppose you'd like to update the display when a tree item is
double-clicked. There is a `wxEVT_COMMAND_TREE_ITEM_ACTIVATED` event
corresponding to this action so typically you'd do something like this:

```cpp
TreeViewFrame::TreeViewFrame() {
    wxTreeCtrl* tree = new wxTreeCtrl(this, ...);
    tree->Bind(wxEVT_COMMAND_TREE_ITEM_ACTIVATED, &TreeViewFrame::OnActivated, this);

    // This is the window showing the current item.
    m_view = new ViewWindow(this);

    DisplayItem(initial);
}

void TreeViewFrame::OnActivated(wxTreeEvent& event) {
    // ... retrieve the item to show from the event (typically using client data) ...
    DisplayItem(item);
}

void TreeViewFrame::DisplayItem(ItemType item) {
    m_view->ShowItem(item);
    // Give the focus to the view to allow the user to easily use the keyboard.
    m_view->SetFocus();
}
```

And this works perfectly well except that the view doesn't get the focus after
double clicking an item in the tree under Windows. The reason for this is that
the native tree control there sends the activation event first and then
processes the (second) mouse click which resulted in it itself, and as part of
this processing it sets the focus to the control itself (as it's normal for the
control to become focused when clicked). So while the view does get focus during
the activation event handler execution, it loses it almost immediately
afterwards.

In a perfect world, wxWidgets would somehow isolate you from this peculiarity of
Windows tree control implementation. But doing this is rather not trivial and,
remember, this is just one of several examples. So in the imperfect world we
live in, you need to deal with this problem at your application level.
`CallAfter()` reduces the imperfectness of having to do it to acceptably low
level as all you need to change in the snippet above to make it work is to
replace the last line of the event handler with the call to it:

```cpp
void TreeViewFrame::OnActivated(wxTreeEvent& event) {
    // ... retrieve the item to show from the event (typically using client data) ...
    CallAfter(&TreeViewFrame::DisplayItem, item);
}
```

All we did was to delay the item display until the next event loop iteration
after the one which dispatched the activated event itself and this is enough to
get rid of the focus problem.

So if you have any capture, focus or other global state problems (and notice
that they can stem from your own code as well, and not just behaviour of the
native controls or wxWidgets itself), you can often use `CallAfter()` to easily
solve them by just postponing whatever you need to do until slightly later.
Remember that [laziness] is a cardinal virtue for a programmer -- and now
wxWidgets helps you to cultivate it!

P.S. But we'll still try to release 2.9.5 soon...
