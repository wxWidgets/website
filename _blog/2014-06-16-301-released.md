We have just released wxWidgets 3.0.1, a bug fix release in 3.0 branch. The
release files can be downloaded from either [SourceForge] or our [FTP mirror] as
usual, and as less usual, but is the case for the last few releases, we provide
not only the sources and documentation, but also the binaries for the selected
Windows compilers.

This release is 100% compatible with 3.0.0, i.e. any code which compiled and
worked with 3.0.0 continues to do so with 3.0.1 and so upgrading to 3.0.1
doesn't require any changes and hence is recommended for all 3.0.0 users:
basically, without any extra effort on your part (even make or project files
don't need to be updated as the libraries use the same names in 3.0 branch), you
get more than a hundred bug fixes and improvements.

The [release announcement] has some details about the changes in this release,
but there were really too many of them to list them all, so you should consult
the description of the most important changes in the [change log] directly to
really appreciate the scope of the work gone into this release (and the change
log doesn't contain relatively unimportant fixes).

Finally, in addition to the bug fixes, if you are using Microsoft Visual Studio
2012 or 2013, there is an extra reason for upgrading to 3.0.1: this release
includes the project and solution files for building the library with these
compilers, so you don't need to upgrade Visual Studio 2010 projects manually any
longer. These projects have been contributed by Artur Wieczorek and I'd like to
use this opportunity to thank him for this and numerous other enhancements and
bug fixes, especially in wxMSW, as Artur managed to eradicate many bugs that I
couldn't fix since many years and is responsible for a good part of the 100+ bug
fixes mentioned above. Thank you!
