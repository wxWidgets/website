Welcome to the wxBlog!

There is a bit of a flurry on the development side lately in an effort to get
out a 2.8 release. According to a recent thread on wx-dev (the developer mailing
list), there are several reasons for this. The most prevalent reason appears to
be the impending release of Leopard (or OSX 10.5), the next version of the
macintosh operating system. Stefan Csomor, the lead of the mac port of
wxWidgets, expressed that the mac port of wxWidgets was not "up to snuff" enough
for leopard.

A possible part of the reasoning is that wxWidgets is included in Tiger (OSX
10.4), and is going to be included in Leopard as well.

Several possible targets were discussed. Stefen expressed a desire to get the
final 2.8 release in time for Leopard, possibly as soon as the end of the month
(November 1). Some others discussed an end-of-year target.

Currently discussions are underway for the release of 2.7.1, the next
development version.
