After receiving the latest monthly [Source Forge] newsletter with their list of
top 25 projects I became curious because at first glance it had seemed like most
of them were Web-based applications and I wondered if it really was so. So I
spent 10 minutes clicking on all the 25 links and quickly looking at the
programming languages, environments, and frameworks these projects used, and
here is what I found (please bear in mind that I could easily make some errors,
all this is very quick and rough):

1.  <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/>: Web/PHP
2.  <http://adempiere.sourceforge.net/>: Java
3.  <http://www.zkoss.org/>: Java
4.  <http://arianne.sf.net/>: Java
5.  <http://www.finkproject.org/>: Perl(?)
6.  <http://portableapps.com/>: Python
7.  <http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/>: C++/wx (and Qt?)
8.  <http://jmri.sourceforge.net/>: Java
9.  <http://www.net-snmp.org/>: C
10. <http://www.scummvm.org/>: C++
11. <http://www.taskcoach.org/>: Python/wx
12. <http://www.xoops.org/>: Web/PHP
13. <http://squirrelmail.org/>: Web/PHP
14. <http://postbooks.sourceforge.net/>: C++/Qt
15. <http://www.openbravo.com/>: Java
16. <http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/>: C
17. <http://www.freedos.org/>: C
18. <http://pwsafe.org/>: C++/wx
19. <http://getgreenshot.org/>: C#
20. <http://www.omegat.org/>: Java
21. <http://tuxpaint.org/>: C/SDL
22. <http://www.dvdstyler.org/>: C++/wx
23. <http://keepass.info/>: C++/MFC
24. <http://www.dvtk.org/>: C++ (?)
25. <http://www.scintilla.org/>: C++

As you can see, actually my initial impression was totally wrong and there are
only 3 web-based applications (incidentally, all written in PHP) whereas there
are twice as many written in Java. What really surprised me, however, was that 4
of them used wxWidgets (although I'm not sure if it's the main UI used by
MediaInfo as it also seems to use Qt). I knew about DVDStyler but not the other
ones so it was a pleasant surprise.

Of course, I have no idea what are the exact criteria for choosing these 25
"top" projects and there are plenty of Open Source projects not hosted on
SourceForge, without even speaking about all the other ones, and so on but,
still, it seems like wxWidgets is more popular than I thought (and otherwise I
wouldn't have written this post, would I?).
