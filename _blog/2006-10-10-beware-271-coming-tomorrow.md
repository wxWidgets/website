wxWidgets 2.7.1 will be released on Wednesday October 11 2006 (I thought the
year was worth mentioning, especially for people used to our usual release
schedules). So today you have the last chance to test your code using the latest
CVS sources or the last [daily snapshot] and let us know about any new problems
in 2.7.1 so that we could fix them before the release (and, of course, break
something else to compensate for it).

Please pay attention to the documented incompatible changes in the beginning of
`docs/changes.txt`, especially if you hadn't used 2.7.0 before.

Thank you for testing!
