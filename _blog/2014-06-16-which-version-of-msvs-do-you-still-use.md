As you [might know], we've recently dropped support for VC98, and now I've
started thinking about which versions of MSVC we should support in wxWidgets
3.1.0 release. Even for 3.0, we only provide binaries for 2008 and later, and by
the time 3.2 is out, Microsoft will probably have released at least a couple of
more compiler versions, so we will probably have to drop at least it to from the
list of binaries by then. I don't really think we are going to fully drop
support for it though, doing it for only a 7-8 year old compiler would be quite
out of character. But who knows?

And, in fact, I'd very much like to know more about the versions of the
compilers that wxWidgets users really use. So here is a small poll, please take
a few seconds to click on the _earliest_ version of MSVC that you still use:

And, if you have any trouble with voting here, you can also do it directly from
the [poll page].

Thanks in advance!
