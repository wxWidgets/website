This year we have surprisingly few proposals from the students willing to work
on wxWidgets during this year [Google Summer of Code]. All the previous times
when we participated in the GSoC we had more proposals than the slots allocated
to wxWidgets but this year it looks like the reverse might happen for the very
first time as two days before the proposal submission deadline we only have two
worthy proposals and a couple more of more or less junk ones while, for
comparison, the last year we had 7 or 8 interesting proposals and 5-6 or more of
lesser quality but still not quite worthless.

And as we always had enough good proposals to take all the slots we were
assigned, we never really did much advertisement for it. However this year it
looks like it was a bad mistake to not do it so, considering that later is still
better than never (even if it's really very late -- again, there are only 2 days
left before the [deadline]), I'd like to ask for the help of the readers of this
blog with spreading the word about SGoC in general and wxWidgets participation
in it in particular among any students (and maybe also professors) you might
know.

Personally I'm convinced that for any student interested in working on a real
life yet fun and interesting project during the summer vacation, learning both
more about the technical subject and also about how to work in an open source
community in general and, moreover, be paid on successful completion of the
project, participating in GSoC is really a great opportunity -- so please let
know anybody who might be concerned about it.

Thanks in advance!
