Two months ago, I've asked about the oldest version of MSVS you were still
using. Without further ado, here are the results of the poll:

I admit to have been (pleasantly) surprised by the number of VC12 users. Of
course, this poll, as all web polls, is certainly biased because of the
absolutely non-random participants selection, but I still want to believe these
results and so we'll probably drop (until enough people object very loudly) VC7
support too soon. VC8 is not much more popular, but there are quite few
differences between it and VC9 and we'll still keep supporting the latter one
for quite some time, so VC8 can piggyback on its support anyhow.

Thanks to everybody who voted!
