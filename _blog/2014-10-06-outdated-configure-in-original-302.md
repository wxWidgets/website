Due to my mistake, 3.0.2 source archives contained an out of date version of
configure from 3.0.1. The new archives have with the fixed version have been
uploaded now, please redownload if you are using Unix (or configure with MSYS or
Cygwin under Windows) and had already downloaded one of
`wxWidgets-3.0.2.{7z,tar.bz2,zip}` files.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
