As mentioned in a comment on a previous post, the <http://www.wxwidgets.org>
website is currently blank and has been so for a few hours now. Robin Dunn
mentioned on the users mailing list that the likely cause is that
vhost.sourceforge.net is currently down; alternate addresses such as

<http://wxwindows.sourceforge.net/>

Still appear to work.

Recently in the past there were also issues with speed of the site as well,
possibly concerning sourceforge hosting; specifically image loading. Sometimes
images would only load half the time. Images were shifted to and from an
alternate server (run by Kevin Olliver) in an attempt to provide a temporary fix
for the issue.
