Release candidate for the next 2.9.3 is available from [SourceForge] and soon
will also be at [FTP mirror].

Please test the distribution files and let us know about any problems you
encounter with downloading, compiling or installing from them. If all goes well
the final 2.9.3 should be done next week.

Thanks in advance for your help!
