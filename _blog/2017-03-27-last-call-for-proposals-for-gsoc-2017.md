This is just a reminder that wxWidgets is one of the mentoring organizations in
this year [Google Summer of Code] program and we are looking for proposals from
motivated students with knowledge of C++ and interest for cross-platform
development.

There is less than a week remaining before the deadline for submitting GSoC
applications, so, if you are a student, or know of a student, interested in
participating, please hurry up!
