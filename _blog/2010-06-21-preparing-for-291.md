Sorry for lack of posts summarizing the recent wxWidgets development progress
and here, to compensate, is a post about an upcoming development: we're finally
going to release 2.9.1 soon. This release will include many of the things
previously discussed here, notably new [debug build] handling, [thread-safe
wxLog], new [wxInfoBar] class and so on.

It will also probably be the penultimate release before 3.0 as the current
thinking is to release 2.9.2 after merging the work of the students on GSoC
projects this summer some time in September and then follow with a 3.0 release
before the end of the year. So testing and finding bugs and, even worse,
regressions compared to the old 2.8 versions would be very welcome.

The schedule for this one is to make a release candidate before the end of this
week and the final one on July 12 or, if any important problems are found with
the RC, on July 19 to give us some time to ~~hide them under the carpet~~ fix
them.
