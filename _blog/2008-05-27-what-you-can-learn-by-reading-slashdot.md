[Slashdot] had an interesting post today linking to [a project] which studied
the degree of separation between different [Wikipedia] articles. Possibly moved
by the subconscious feeling of shame due to the fact I was reading Slashdot
instead of working on wx I decided to check what does it have to say about the
closeness of wxWidgets to paradise. And the result was:

[Slashdot]: https://slashdot.org/
[a project]: http://mu.netsoc.ie/wiki/
[Wikipedia]: https://www.wikipedia.org/

**Shortest path from wxwidgets to paradise**

* [WxWidgets]
* [November 27]
* [Eastern Orthodox Church]
* [Paradise]

**3 clicks needed**

[WxWidgets]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets
[November 27]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_27
[Eastern Orthodox Church]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church
[Paradise]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise

I say we're pretty close to the goal! Even better, while we're only 3 clicks
removed from [Qt] too, Qt itself is 1 click further from paradise than wx is.
They have some work to do (but then maybe this is what they're doing, instead of
reading Slashdot...)
