This is a follow up to the [previous post] about wx acceptance into GSoC 2009.
We have had many great proposals this year -- it was the best year for us so far
from this point of view IMO -- and the only regret is that only 3 of them could
have been accepted, I really feel sorry for some students who have clearly put a
good effort in making their application. Nevertheless I can't really be sad
about it because the 3 that were accepted look pretty exciting to me. There are:

*   Bartosz Bekier's project for [adding file-system notification events].
*   Malcolm MacLeod's [wxAUI enhancements] project.
*   Peter Cawley's [ribbon bar for wxWidgets] project.

I'm mentoring the first one of those so I'm naturally quite interested in it but
the wxAUI project is clearly very much needed too and in spite of my initial
opposition to the idea of including ribbon bar into wx, it turned out to be the
most popular proposal among both students and wx users so it definitely will be
great to have too.

Finally, just as during the last year GSoC, even if wx itself has only received
3 slots, there is also at least one other wx-related project in a different
organization: Perl has one slot for [creating Perl bindings for wxWebKit]. And
[Audacity] is participating in GSoC again as well and while [their projects]
don't seem to be especially wx-related it is still nice to see wx applications
being part of GSoC. OTOH it's a pity that none [30 Python projects] seem to be
wxPython related, especially as wxPython itself is not part of the GSoC this
year but well, like this we have something to hope for the next year :-)

In the meanwhile good luck to Bartosz, Malcolm and Peter and looking forward to
their contributions to wx!
