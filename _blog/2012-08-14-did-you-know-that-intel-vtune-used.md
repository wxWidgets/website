Well, I didn't know this but reading the release notes for a new update I've
just downloaded I noticed the following at the end of the document:

    wxWindows Library
    This tool includes wxWindows software which can be downloaded from
    http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads.
    wxWindows Library Licence, Version 3.1
    ======================================

And, indeed, Ctrl-Alt-middle-clicking on VTune window gives:

Sometimes I forget that only a very small proportion of all wxWidgets users
reads mailing lists (let alone posts to them), the forums and so on and that
there are plenty of companies that use wxWidgets that we have no idea about at
all. So it's not really surprising to find that Intel uses wxWidgets but it's
still nice to have them in our users list!
