What would like to see out of wxBlog?

Current ideas are:

* Weekly recaps
* Just major events

Maybe this with personal commentary by developers and former developers?

This blog was started not really out of personal need, but more out of some of
the ideas on the developer's mailing list. I (Ryan) will of course try to have a
little fun every now and then as well.

Feel free to comment!
