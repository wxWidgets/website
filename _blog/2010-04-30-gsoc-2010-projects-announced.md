We're very happy to announce that five students have been accepted by [Google
Summer of Code] program to work on wxWidgets this summer. Our congratulations
to:

*   Mingquan Yang who will enhance images support in [wxRichTextCtrl].
*   Rickard Westerlund who will bring support to new Windows Vista/7
    [UI elements] to wxWidgets.
*   Julien Weinzorn who will implement the masked edit control.
*   Javier Torres who will work on [wxQt] port implementation.
*   Steven Lamerton who will add many more unit tests for wxWidgets GUI classes.

If you're wondering about the order, it's really random -- or, rather, reversed
(because using the straight one all the time is not fair, especially if your
name starts with 'Z' :-) alphabetical order of names.

The projects are a mix of concrete, immediately user-visible improvements and
more ambitious long-term investments. But all of them should be very useful to
wxWidgets and its users.

Thanks once again to Google for organizing the Summer of Code and looking
forward to it!
