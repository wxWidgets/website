We have finally, after a long delay, released 3.0.3, please see the
[announcement] or go directly to the [release page]. As with the previous 3.0.x
releases, there are no important new features in this release, but there are
quite a few bug fixes as well as support for the relatively recent compiler,
platforms and third-party libraries versions which were not yet (widely)
available at the time of 3.0.2, so upgrading to it is _strongly_ recommended for
all 3.0 users, especially because it is so simple: the new release is 100%
compatible with 3.0.2 and doesn't require any changes to your applications code
or, if you are using shared libraries, not even recompiling it.  

As always, thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release (at least 66
people according to git commit information, but certainly more in practice) and
helped with preparing it, by building the binaries, documentation and testing
it!
