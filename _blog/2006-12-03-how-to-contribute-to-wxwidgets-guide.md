We often have the impression that wxWidgets could be so much better if only we
had more time to fix the known problems with it, to implement all these
[exciting new features] it still lacks or even just to fix the [numerous old
bugs]. But unfortunately the time is always lacking (isn't it funny that you can
regularly find jokes about 48 hour days in wx-related email since the beginning
of the nineties?) and so many things remain undone. So the next idea, after
failing to change the duration of the day, is to encourage more people to work
on wxWidgets -- and it seems especially actual now that programming is becoming
all about parallelization to take advantage of new multi-processor machines. And
attracting new contributors does work rather nicely (better than trying to
construct time dilatation machine, anyhow), for instance several new developers
joined us relatively recently and brought us great things like [AUI], [custom
comboboxes] and almost all other [new controls] in the upcoming 2.8.0 release.

[numerous old bugs]: https://trac.wxwidgets.org/wiki/Stats
[AUI]: http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui/screenshots.html
[custom comboboxes]: https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_combo_ctrl.html
[new controls]: https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/WX_2_8_BRANCH/docs/changes.txt

But we'd still like to attract even more! And maybe it's our own fault, after
all, if people don't flock to wxWidgets development. We don't do much
advertisement (real programmers hate marketing) and we don't even explain
clearly how to become a wxWidgets contributor anywhere. Personally, as I want to
keep my real programmer badge, I can't really address the former issue but at
least I tried to help with the latter and so wrote this [guide] to explain how
**_you_** can help with wxWidgets development. It is probably not as useful as
it could be as it's hard for me to understand what questions and problems can a
newcomer to wxWidgets (and/or open source development in general) have. But
hopefully this guide is better than nothing at all and I'm looking forward to
improving it in the future with feedback from the people it is really addressed
to.

So thanks in advance for any comments about this guide! As for me, I'm finally
going to log off and have a few hours of sleep after my 40 hours wxWidgets
working day, safe in the knowledge that hundreds of new developers are going to
join the project tomorrow ;-)
