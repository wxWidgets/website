After an average of one post every 6 months or so on this blog, good news just
can't stop coming now, with a second post in just 3 days. This one is to
announce that wxWidgets has been allocated two slots in this year Google [Summer
of Code] program and Prashant Kumar and Jose Lorenzo will be working on adding
support for multi-touch gestures and providing better integration with
JavaScript in wxWebView this summer.

Congratulations to Prashant and Jose and thanks to everybody else who applied
(but, unfortunately, couldn't be accepted) to work on wxWidgets and also to our
mentors: Cătălin Răceanu, Mariano Reingart and Steven Lamerton. And good luck to
all involved!
