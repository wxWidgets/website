We have just made 3.0.0-rc2 files available. There are no truly exciting changes
since 3.0.0-rc1 but this is the final release candidate before 3.0, so please
test your applications with it and let us know if you find any real showstopper
problems for the last chance of fixing them before 3.0.

You can get the release files, including binaries for not only MSVC but also
MinGW-TDM this time, from [SourceForge]. More details are in the [release
announcement post] and you can discuss this release on [reddit].
