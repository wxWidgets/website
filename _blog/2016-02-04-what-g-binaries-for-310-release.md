We plan to provide g++ binaries for the upcoming release, but we're not sure
what are the versions and the build options that people would be interested in,
so here is a quick poll to gather some information about this:

<a class="OPP-powered-by" href="https://www.murvey.com" style="text-decoration:none;"></a>

Please select 1-3 options corresponding to the binaries that would be useful to
you to allow us to make the best choice. Thanks in advance!
