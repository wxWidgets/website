wxWidgets is participating in the [Google Summer of Code] again this year and we
are very glad to announce that this year 6 projects have been allocated for us,
which is the most we have ever had!

We had many excellent proposals this year and unfortunately even in spite of
getting so many slots, not all of them could have been selected, but here is the
list of the ones that were:

*   Chaobin Zhang will add support for "new" (since Windows Vista) taskbar
    features under Windows such as progress display indicator, jump lists,
    buttons and so on.
*   Haojian Wu will integrate support for Chromium backend into `wxWebView` to
    provide a backend that could be used on all platforms in addition or instead
    of the native one.
*   Mariano Reingart will continue improving wxQt port and will look into the
    possibility of bringing wxWidgets to Android via Qt bridge.
*   Alexandru Pana will work on implementing Direct2D and DirectWrite-based
    version of `wxGraphicsContext`, which should result in much better
    performance and, for text output, quality than the current GDI+-based
    implementation.
*   Nikola Miljkovic will lay the grounds of wxAndroid port: this is the most
    difficult but also arguably the most exciting project.
*   Sun Boxiang will work on improving wxUniv port and in particular make it
    good enough to be used for simple UI under Android.

As usual, big thanks to Google for organizing the Summer of Code and best of
luck to all the students!
