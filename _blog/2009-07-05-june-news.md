Here is a brief summary of changes in wxWidgets during the past month. Once
again, we (and I in particular) didn't do time to do as many things as we'd like
to but less is better than nothing. And, in case of the most important new
feature added, later is hopefully better than nothing as I seem to remember
requests for it at least 10 years ago -- and now, finally, we do finally have ...
drums roll, please ... [support for images in wxButton]:

[support for images in wxButton]: https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_button.html#5caa1163418c868140ba3021fc20578e

<img src="button_msw.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Button image on MSW">
<img src="button_gtk.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Button image on GTK">
<img src="button_osx.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Button image on OSX">

Note that the images, and hence button sizes, are different in the screenshots
above because the standard `wxART_INFORMATION` icon is used which is
platform-dependent.

Another important even if somewhat technical change was the harmonization of
handling of different background styles under all (major) platforms, as
[discussed here]. As a side effect, this allows background bitmaps in
wxHtmlWindow to work again in wxOSX/Carbon.

Other miscellaneous changes:

*   Some wxFont convenient methods such as `Bold()`, `Larger()`, `Smaller()` and
    non-const versions `MakeBold()`, `MakeLarger()`, `MakeSmaller()` were added:
    see "Similar fonts creation" section in [wxFont documentation].
*   There were several additions to XRC:
    *   [wxFileCtrl] handler was added (thanks to Kinaou Hervé)
    *   [wxEditableListBox] handler was added too
    *   All existing window handlers gained support for `ownfg`, `ownbg` and
        `ownfont` tags corresponding to the [appropriate][] [wxWindow][]
        [methods][].
*   wxDirCtrl gained support for multiple selections (thanks to Steve Lamerton)
*   wxStandardPaths behaviour under Windows is now more flexible, see its new [IgnoreAppSubDir()] method.
*   wxVariant was improved to support wxLongLong.

Speaking of wxVariant, Jaakko is currently working on the new, better, safer and
more efficient replacement for it called [wxAny]. Any feedback about it would be
very appreciated as we'd really like to make a class we wouldn't be later
ashamed of (which is unfortunately a feeling I often have about wxVariant).

Finally, the usual statistics: there were 418 commits to the repository, 95
tickets were created or reopened and 70 tickets were fixed (hmm, I wonder if the
label "progress" is this still applicable?).
