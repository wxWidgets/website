Qt [switch to LGPL] has triggered a [thread] with subject "Bad thing for
wxWidgets Qt will be in LGPL" on wx-users mailing list which clearly implies
that this is indeed a bad thing. But is it one really?

First, let's not be egoistic: even if this were bad for wx, it's surely
excellent news for just about everybody \[else\]. I do applaud Nokia for doing
the right thing and I'm personally very glad that even people in big
multinational companies such as Nokia understand the benefits of open source.

Second, this certainly will bring more users to Qt. But I'm not sure it's going
to happen at the expense of wxWidgets users. I rather think more people thinking
to use Java or C# or C (with GTK) could reconsider their choice and use C++ with
Qt. The reason for this cautious optimism is that the cost of Qt has never been
the only reason for choosing wxWidgets over it. Of course, this hasn't ever been
important for GPL applications anyhow. And, surprisingly, it often wasn't very
important for commercial applications neither as companies often choose to pay
for wxWidgets support anyhow even if the library itself is free. So I think that
relatively few of people who had chosen wxWidgets in the past would change their
mind now, as the other two main reasons for this choice -- the use of native
widgets by wxWidgets and the absence of any preprocessor -- remain as valid as
ever.

Finally, if more people use C++ for developing cross-platform applications this
is good for wxWidgets even if they use Qt because the whole idea of writing
portable programs is unfortunately still not as entrenched in mass conscience as
it should be in our opinion. So this could yet turn out to be positive for
wxWidgets, although more likely it's not going to change much for us one way or
the other.

But this remains great news for the open source community (of which we are part)
so I just can't bring myself to regret it. I can dream about wxTNG which would
combine the best features of wx and Qt but this still remains a dream for now...
