I've recently needed to add a small new feature to [wxSpinCtrl]: possibility to
display and enter the numbers in hexadecimal format. This is done now with the
addition of [SetBase()] method, so now you can either call `SetBase(16)`
explicitly in the code or use ["base"] XRC property by adding `<base>16</base>`
to your XRC files (this needs to be done manually as dialog editors don't have
support for it yet). Just in case you're curious, here is how the new control
looks in the updated widgets sample under OS X:

But as a side effect of working on this, I've also fixed a few other bugs in
`wxSpinCtrl`, hence this progress report:

*   First, I've simply removed wxOSX version of this control. Strangely enough,
    we had a generic implementation of it for wxOSX which was different from
    another generic implementation used for all other platforms. They were not
    identical but pretty similar and at least now we only have one version to
    maintain.
*   Next I [fixed] the funny [bug] with contents of the control being shown as
    password field if `wxALIGN_CENTRE` was used. Even though it's more correct
    to use `wxTE_CENTRE`, it's more user-friendly to support both versions,
    especially as the documentation was rather confusing on this subject until
    recently.
*   I also [added] the generation of `wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_ENTER` to the generic
    wxSpinCtrl which didn't send them at all before. This fixed [another bug] as
    generic wxSpinCtrl was also used for wxSpinCtrlDouble under wxMSW, and so
    this event wasn't sent when using real-valued spin controls under Windows,
    even though it was sent with integer-valued ones.
*   But integer-valued Windows wxSpinCtrl was not without problems neither: the
    value carried by its events wrapped over when it was greater than
    `SHRT_MAX`, i.e. 32767. So I [fixed this] as well.

There are still some bugs left in wxSpinCtrl, e.g. settings colours doesn't work
correctly in the generic version but it's in a much better shape now than only a
few days ago.
