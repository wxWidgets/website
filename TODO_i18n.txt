about/i18n
----------

- Add i18n-status.js datetime file info into the page
- Generate directories and related translators page indexes (markdown source?)
  for each language

A possible replacement to a cron job could be using a post recieve hook in
the wx source repository, so update the i18n-status.js file and push it in the
wx website one; I still didn't try this,
I've included an example in the githooks directory.
